# Code -----------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 2: The Identification of the Pattern in the Univariate Case

### The code is organized into two main parts to identify the patterns 
### of the univariate with two and three cases.  

## Chapter 3: The Identification of the Pattern in the Bivariate Case

### The code is organized into four main parts to identify the patterns 
### of the romantic satisfaction, the emotional distress, and to reproduce the 
### sensitive analysis and the comparison between AIC and BIC. 

## Chapter 4: The Sensitive Analysis 

### The code is organized into three main parts that runs the sensitive analysis
### for the univariate case with two states, the univariate case with three
### states and finally the bivariate case. 

## Chapter 6: Clustering Analysis for the Univariate Case 

### The code is organized into three main parts. The two first parts show the 
### detailed code for the AM and PM patterns. The last part reproduces the 
### illustration. 

## Chapter 7: Clustering Analysis for the Bivariate Case 

### The code is organized into five main parts that follow the classic method
### for clustering. 

## Chapter 8: Extension I: Stress communication and Dyadic Coping 

### The code is organized into five main parts. The first part shows the 
### function to compute the theoretical count matrix for APM. Then, the second
### and third parts identify the pattern and run the classic analysis for MDS. 
### The last two parts do the detailed analysis for the pattern for the women 
### and the men respectively. 

## Chapter 9: Extension II: Stress communication and Dyadic Coping 

### The code is organized into four main parts that reproduce the analysis 
### for the IM.
